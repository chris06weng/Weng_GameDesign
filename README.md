Classroom Champion - Chris Weng
1. The goal of classroom champion is to find out which class at Harvard Westlake is the best class (at video games)
2. The game is a website accessible to all Harvard Westlake students
3. The setting of the game is the Harvard Westlake Upper School
    1. School boundaries are outside of the gate
    2. If you leave the boundaries through a non-security gate, you will be teleported back to spawn (the parking lot) automatically
    3. General game spawn is the parking lot, but during each class your spawn is in your classroom
    4. Every classroom is a replica of the real class at Harvard Westlake
4. Each player has a customizable avatar that is normal human size (relative to the game map) and can choose a PG-13 username when they create their account
    1. Players can freely go around campus and interact with the map
    2. Certain items can be picked up / carried around
    3. Players have a backpack with limited size for items
    4. Players can carry two items at once
    5. Players have infinite energy but have to alternate between crouching, running and sprinting, as player can only sprint for short durations, run by default, and crouch when pressing shift
    6. Players are countrolled by wasd, and the perspective is controlled by mouse/trackpad
    7. Players have a health bar with 100 health
    8. Players lose health due to interactions with other players or taking damage while interacting with the map
    9. If a player dies, they will drop all their items and respawn at the parking lot
5. Each player is put into a team with their classmates (different teams for every Block)
6. Players who have a Block free are wild cards and roam the map freely
8. During each Block, the game is on passive mode, where each team goes around the map completing missions/competitions. All teams have the same missions and competitions, so they can compete with one another. Points are awarded for each mission and competition, and a running scoreboard of the team with the most points is always displayed on screen. 
9. Missions/Competitions:
    1. Pick up trash + 1
    2. Eliminate a player from another team + 5
    3. Get eliminated by another player - 2
    4. High five the cafeteria staff + 1
    5. Sneak past security off campus + 10
    6. Get caught by security - 5
    7. Beat another team in a race on the field + 10
    8. Get beat by another team in a race on the field - 5
    9. If a team collectively kills more than 10 other players during passive mode, their whole team is trapped inside their classroom for the rest of the Block
10. Once during each Block, the game becomes active and the game goes into battle mode. The teams must find accessible weapons on campus and then battle until one team remains.
11. Battle Points
   1. Killing a player + 10 points
   2. For every kill, points accumulate on the player
   3. In order to deposit points, the player must return to base (their classroom)
   4. If killed, a player will drop half their points on the ground, while the other half are automatically deposited.
   5. Points dropped on the ground can be picked up by any player
   6. During battle mode, each player has only one life, and after getting killed the player will spawn in "jail" (the parking lot, but you can't leave until the battle is over)
12. Rewards:
    1. First place - extra credit + 20
    2. Second place - extra credit + 10
    3. Third place - extra credit + 5
13. The game resets after every week so that no one team can pull ahead too far
14. The game is disabled after school ends so that kids have time to do homework and only waste time in class!
